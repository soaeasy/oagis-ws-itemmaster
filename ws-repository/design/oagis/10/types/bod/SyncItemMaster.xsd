This BOD may also be initiated by the sending system upon some event occurring.

This BOD is not for synchronizing ITEM quantities at each inventory location.   The SyncInventoryBalance Business Object Document is used for this purpose.

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a MRP, Inventory, or Manufacturing business application could use this to communicate item information. 

This BOD can be used to synchronize items used in finished goods, raw materials, work-in-process or components in a bill of materials.</xsd:documentation>
